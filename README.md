DotsOfWar
=========

Funny and pretty simple tactical 2D game

This game is being developed by one developer and just for fun. 

=========

I was playing this game (we called it just "dots") very often in my student years. 
And I always been wondering, why there isn't any version of this game for desktop or mobile platforms? 
So I started this project to master my programming skills and to make the world see this catchy multiplayer game.

=========

The game is in early development status by now, and I'm really going to fill up my boring evenings with process of
creating something new, process of learning and experiencing.
